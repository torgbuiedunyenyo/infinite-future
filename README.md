# Infinite Future

This is an experiment in generative UI. It generates an image, text, and then all of the HTLM and CSS for the website as well.

I guarantee none of the code, it is a quickly-made demo, and a lot of the code is AI-generated. Use it however you want, at your own risk.

For the record, what I most proud of isn't actually the generative UI, it is that I think my text prompt actually gets the AI "smell" out of the writing.

## Features

Built on Next.js, so if for some crazy reason you want to deploy your own version of this, Vercel is probably a good option.
